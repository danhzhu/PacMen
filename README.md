# PacMen
### Description
This is a PacMen Game. When you click the “Add PacMan” button, a new pacman would appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the “Start Game” button, the pacman or pacmen created would start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it would change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
### How to Run
After git clone this repo, open the index.html in a web browser (Chrome is preferred). Then you can start playing the game.
### Roadmap of future improvements
Future improvements include adding collision checks when two or more pacmen coming across each other, then they could either all disappear or change directions randomly.
